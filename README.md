Emulating a Classic Toy with a JavaScript Web Application

    DESCRIPTION



        Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emulate the user experience of the popular children’s toy, the Mattel® ‘See ‘N’ Say Storymaker’. Please note that this is an individual assignment – please ensure that all work is your own.



    INSTRUCTIONS



        - Watch the short video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG8y_e6t0G4 (limegl0wstix, 2010), and carefully watch how the user interacts with the toy.
        - Build a simple HTML page featuring 5 buttons or links - one for each of the 5 words or phrases the user will need to create their story. Then add one more button or link that the user can click to see their finished story.
        - When the user clicks on each of the buttons or links, your script should cycle through an array of words or phrases for that particular part of the sentence until they are happy with a  particular choice (review the above video to see this demonstrated). Output their choice visually as the button or link text or maybe beside it so they can see what choice they have made?
        - The last button or link will allow the user to view the completed story. When the user clicks this button or link, a function will combine all of the 5 words or phrases selected by the user into a sentence that will then be output to the screen in some way.
        - Once you’ve completed the functionality of the interface, add some CSS to make the page visually attractive (don’t spend too much time on this – the focus is the JavaScript).
        Ensure that all your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is validated, well-commented, formatted, and organized with care.


    TAKE IT FURTHER



        - Add another button or link that generates a random story with one click.
        - Build a reset button or link so that another story can be created.
        - Try as much as possible to create a user experience that matches the original product (see image below).
        - Output the random story as audio output as well as text.
        - Create an alternate collection of words and phrases to build a different type of story.
        - Anything else that you can dream up...
